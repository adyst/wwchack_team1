## Description

Alfred is a smart recycle bin that pulls information from your recycling bin lid (incl. gas levels, humidity, and weight) and uses machine learning to help the user determine if they are following best recycling practices. The goal of the product is to help reduce the amount of recycling that is contaminated and eventually thrown into a landfill from poor recycling habits.
